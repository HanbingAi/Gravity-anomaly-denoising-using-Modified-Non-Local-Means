# Gravity-anomaly-denoising-using-Modified-Non-Local-Means
This is the README for applying the Modified Non-Local Means (MNLM) to denoise gravity anomaly: 
I uploaded all the files including 4 MATLAB files (in ".m") and 2 raw synthetic data file (in ".XYZ"). The main function for MNLM can be found in "NLM_II.m", detailed parameter description are involved in this program. 
"Synthetic_Test_For_MNLM.m" presents a complete case of denoising using MNLM. Users can open the "Synthetic_Test_For_MNLM.m" and click the "run" button in MATLAB to launch the test 
(make sure the MATLAB is already installed).
